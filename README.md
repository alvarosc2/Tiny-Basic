# Tiny-Basic
This is my own version of the 70's interpreter tiny basic
This is an attempt to create a tiny basic interpreter. I am not a good programmer so my code is not quite beautiful or elegant.
The program as it is now is absolute rubbish, it is very buggy and hence a lot of things must be fixed.
